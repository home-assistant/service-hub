    The ESPHome Dashboard is not linked to Home Assistant (even if running as an addon).

    Just because you have your device in the ESPHome dashboard,
    does not mean that Home Assistant is connected to it and you still need to
    [add it as a device](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=esphome)
