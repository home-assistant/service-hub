'404':
  description: "404"
  content: >-
    **404** Error for docker usually is a result of one of these things:


    - The image tag you are trying to use does not exist (if this is the case
    you will see the word 'manifest' in the error)


    - There is not enough space left on the device to download the new
    container.

    - There was a networking issue preventing the image from being downloaded.
'502':

    If you're getting a 502 from an add-on then the add-on isn't running.


    On Zigbee2MQTT a common cause is having only one Zigbee coordinator/stick
    and also having enabled ZHA or deCONZ.

rpi4:
  description: "RPi with SSD"
  content: >-
    **Trying to install HAOS with an SSD in Rpi4?** Things you need to know:


    1) Make sure your Pi is updated to a stable
    [bootloader](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711_bootloader_config.md#usbmassstorageboot)
    release that supports USB boot

    2) If install still fails, then your SSD likely needs [quirks
    enabled](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245931) to work
    correctly. Find your adapter's ID and add the quirks parameter to your
    `cmdline.txt` file (found in the boot partition) once you've flashed your
    HAOS image for your Raspberry Pi on the SSD.

    3) If no SD card is used add `sd_poll_once=on` to `dtparam` in `config.txt`
    to get rid of `mmc0: timeout waiting for hardware interrupt` kernel errors.


    If install is still failing then your SSD is perhaps not supported by uboot.
    Try a different drive if you have another one.

    community

    3. Read the [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/) (RTFM). It
    is an open source product, you are allowed to contribute, but not whine

    4. Every setup is unique in its own way. Share your config, code, logs and
    other relevant info via https://hasteb.in/ or https://paste.ubuntu.com/ -
    don't post walls of text in the channels

    5. Keep the channel live by being friendly, offer help where you can, learn
    when you can't!

    6. Remember to review <#331130181102206976>

    **Before You Ask**

    [How To Ask Questions The Smart
    Way](<http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)


    Before asking a technical question in our channels, please do the following:


    1. Try to find an answer by searching the [archives of the
    forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/)

    2. Try to find an answer by searching [the Web](https://www.google.com/)

    3. Try to find an answer by reading [the
    manual](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/)

    4. Try to find an answer by reading [the
    FAQ](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/)

    5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

    6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

    7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading [the source
    code](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant)


    When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things
    first; this will help establish that you're not being a lazy sponge and
    wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing
    these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated
    they can learn from the answers.

  content: >-
    Please use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) or other image sharing web sites, and
    share the link here.


    Image posting is blocked in most channels to discourage people from sharing
    text as images. Sharing text as images assumes that everybody sees the world
    as you do, which isn't the case. Some people are colour blind, or have
    visual impairment that means they can't make sense of an image of text.

    Don't forget to check for any [alerts](https://alerts.home-assistant.io/)


    If you think an upgrade broke something then:

    1. Downgrade to the previous version to check if it works correctly there

    2. If it does then change the `logger` settings for that integration to
    `debug`

    3. Upgrade to the new version again

    4. Look in the logs for errors

    5. Open an issue, following the template provided and including the log
    information

    As an alternative to HA built-in bluetooth tracking, [the monitor
    script](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor) uses separate devices,
    usually [Pi
    Zeroes](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/), to track
    bluetooth devices.

    It uses MQTT topics to relay device status messages to HA. See [this forum
    thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/monitor-reliable-multi-user-distributed-bluetooth-occupancy-presence-detection/68505)
    for more.

    [This forum
    post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-help-us-help-you-or-how-to-ask-a-good-question/114371)
    covers the things we need to know to help you. Key things are the version of
    _Home Assistant_ you're running, how you installed it (Home Assistant OS,
    Supervised, Container, Core), the exact component you're having problems
    with (eg _Nest climate_ rather than _climate_), and details of the problem
    (ideally with any error message in full).

hacs:
  description: "Home Assistant Community Store"
  content: >-
    [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz/) allows for easy installation and management of
    custom unsupported integrations. They
    even have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/apgchf8) for issues with
    HACS itself.
irc:
  description: "IRC"
  content: >-
    Discord isn't like IRC, you don't have to tag people on every response. Keep
    in mind that every time you tag somebody, they get a notification ping. That
    can very quickly become annoying and people may block you.

    When using Discord's new _Reply_ feature it defaults to pinging the person
    you reply to, click `@ ON` to `@ OFF` to stop this - on the right side of
    the compose bar.

devices:

zigbee:
  description: "Zigbee"
  content: >-
    There are three Zigbee options with Home Assistant (regardless of how you
    install it). These are:


    [zha](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) is actively developed
    as part of Home Assistant Core, using the zigpy stack, the UI also being
    part of Home Assistant. The EmberZNet based sticks are recommended (though
    the HUSBZB-1 uses an older chipset), but there [are other
    options](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha#known-working-zigbee-radio-modules)
    including the CC2652 based sticks. There is no list of supported devices, as
    any standards compliant device should work. Devices that require extra
    support are listed, and adding unsupported devices is documented.


    [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) is very actively developed and
    can run in an add-on, in a Docker container, and natively. As of 1.15 has a
    native UI, and it also uses MQTT for control and configuration. It supports
    [mostly TI based
    sticks](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/#recommended), with the
    recommended option being the [CC2652 based
    sticks](https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/551843655682490399/982004122553315360).
    If you want to use an EmberZNet stick see [this
    issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/319#issuecomment-789757269).
    The known working devices are [well
    documented](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/) (which usually
    includes how to pair them so you don't have to find the manual), and adding
    unsupported devices is also documented.


    [deCONZ](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz/) is relatively
    stable and mature with its own UI (and [Discord
    server](https://discord.gg/RNTwa6d)). It can run in an add-on, in a Docker
    container, or natively. Only the ConBee range of sticks and RaspBee GPIO
    boards are supported. Known working devices are documented, and how to
    request support for a new device is documented too (you can't add
    unsupported devices yourself).

    or provide functionality within Home Assistant.


    <#672220642099200000> provide additional software or services, which an
    integration could possibility integrate with. Add-ons are for Home Assistant
    OS and Supervised only, other install methods can install software other
    ways.
windows:
  description: "Windows warning"
  content: >-
    Running Home Assistant in a venv on Windows isn't recommended. Not all
    integrations may work, because some Python packages aren't available. You
    should consider [using
    Docker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/#windows)
    instead, or running on a Linux host.
deconz:
  content: >-
    [deCONZ](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz) by dresden
    elektronik is a software that communicates with ConBee/RaspBee Zigbee
    gateways and exposes Zigbee devices that are connected to the gateway. Our
    <#551843655682490399> channel is a good place to ask about using it with
    Home Assistant, but they also have their own [Discord

    [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a loosely
    coupled, multithreaded, sandboxed python execution environment for writing
    automation apps. It uses the Home Assistant API (or MQTT) to communicate
    with HA. You can get help at [their Discord
    server](https://discord.gg/Mx5qafB).
zigbee2mqtt:
  description: "What is zigbee2mqtt"
  content: >-
    [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) is a Zigbee gateway that uses
    MQTT to communicate with HA and supports a range of TI chipset based
    controllers. Our <#551843655682490399> channel is a good place to ask about
    using it with Home Assistant, but they also have their own [Discord
    server](https://discord.gg/NyseBeK).
integrations:
  description: "Some integrations require YAML"
  content: >-
    Some [integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations) are added
    with YAML, some in the UI. Check the documentation for your integration to
    see which method it uses.
learning:

addon:
  description: "What is an add-on"
  content: >-
    An add-on is a Docker container with tweaks to allow it to be configured in
    the Supervisor UI. It is only available in the Supervised installs
    (<#330990055533576204> and <#330944238910963714>) since if you've used any
    other install method you're able to install software already.
advanced:
  description: "Advanced mode"
  content: >-
    Various settings are hidden unless your [user
    profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile/) has _Advanced mode_
    enabled. These include some add-ons, the Lovelace _Resources_ menu, server
    control options, and more.

test:
  description: "Testing automations"
  content: >-
    To test an automation there's three stages you can follow. Testing the
    action, the condition and action, and the whole automation:


    1) Use _Configuration_ ->
    [_Automations_](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/) to find
    the automation and then push _Run Actions_. If this fails your problem is in
    the `action:` section, and details should be found in your log file

    2) Use _Developer tools_ ->
    [_Services_](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/) and
    call `automation.trigger` on the automation with `skip_condition: false`. If
    the first passes but this fails then the problem is in your `condition:`
    block

    3) Use _Developer tools_ ->
    [_States_](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/) to find
    the trigger entity, click the name, then change the state (at the top) to
    something that'll trigger the automation before pushing _Set State_. If this
    fails then the problem is with your `trigger:` section, or the automation is
    turned off (you can check that in _Developer tools_ ->
    [_States_](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/)).


    You can also see [this section in the
    docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/) and
    with HA 2021.4 onwards [debug
    automations](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/04/07/release-20214/#automation-debugging).

pickyourstick:
  content: >-
    Buy something CC2652 based. [This
    list](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html) is a
    good one, both [Tube](https://www.tubeszb.com/) and
    [Electrolama](https://shop.electrolama.com/) have been proven to have
    excellent customer service. The current generation of EZSP sticks ([see here
    for
    some](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/319#issuecomment-789757269))
    are also a good choice for ZHA.


    Anything CC2530 or CC2531 based should be avoided - they're old, slow, and
    only suitable for a dozen or so devices. The Sonoff ZBbridge isn't advised
    since it uses WiFi (built in interference causing stability/reliability
    issues), and the HUSBZB-1 uses an older chipset so should be avoided.


    Finally, the ConBee range are fine with deCONZ, but experience with ZHA and
    Zigbee2MQTT appears to be mixed.
tagging:
  content: >-
    Generally, don't tag people to ask for help - it comes across as bad
    manners, you’re demanding somebody answers you. It’s different if you’re
    thanking somebody, obviously. If you do tag somebody keep it polite and
    respectful. Remember that everybody is a volunteer, and nobody _has_ to help
    you, and people may block you.


    Similarly, please don’t DM (direct message) people asking for help. It also
    comes across as demanding, and means that others can’t learn from what you
    do.


    Finally, please keep tagging people in replies to a minimum. That too can
    become annoying very quickly and should be used only when it's necessary
    (such as if it's been a long time, or there's multiple conversations going
    on). When using Discord's new _Reply_ feature it defaults to pinging the
    person you reply to, click `@ ON` to `@ OFF` to stop this - on the right
    side of the compose bar.
latest:
  content: '''Latest'' is not a version number. Please provide the actual version number.'

works:
  content: >-
    Want to know if something works with Home Assistant? Here's a few things to
    try:


    1. Look at the [integrations
    list](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations)

    2. Search [community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/)

    3. Try Googling _Home Assistant MYDEVICE_ or _MYDEVICE Python_

features:
  description: "Feature requests"
  content: >-
    If you have a feature request for the frontend you can open [one
    here](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/issues), for Home Assistant
    itself please [post on the
    forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests/13). All other
    feature requests should be made to the developer of that custom
    card/component.
weather:
  description: "Weather"
  content: >-
    There is no universal _best_ [weather
    integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations#weather). Which one
    works best _for you_ depends on where you live - try them all and see which
    is generally the most accurate.
best:
  content: >-
    There is no universal _best_ anything. There's always trade-offs, you need
    to explain:


    * Your priorities/desired features

    * Where in the world you are

    * Your budget

    * Any protocols that you'd prefer (eg Zigbee) or want to avoid (eg Zigbee)

    about that message.
swag:
  description: "SWAG"
  content: >-
    [Secure Web Application Gateway](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag)
    aka SWAG - is the easiest way of setting up a reverse proxy server with SSL
    (using Certbot and LetsEncrypt) for your Docker based install. See [their
    documentation](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag) on it, and if you
    get stuck they also have [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/YWrKVTn) and
    [forum](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag).
tts:
  description: "TTS"
  content: >-
    If `tts` isn't working in your media players (and on a Google device at most
    you get a _bloop_), then the problem is most likely down to SSL. If you're
    using SSL in HA make sure that your
    [`Internet`](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/network/) and
    `Local Network` are set correctly.
elevation:
  description: "Elevation"
  content: >-
    Why use the [sun elevation
    trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#sun-elevation-trigger)
    or
    [condition](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/conditions/#sun-elevation-condition)
    rather than a time offset from sunset or sunrise? Because the elevation more
    consistently relates to the light level than a fixed time offset. An hour
    before sunset is very different light levels on the longest day than the
    shortest day, for example.
everything:
  content: No, there isn't actually a bot command for everything
cc253x:
  content: >-
    The CC2531 and CC2530 sticks are cheap for a reason. They're fine for
    testing, but do yourself a favour and buy something better.


    What something better? Anything CC2652 based ([see here for
    some](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) or
    the current generation EZSP ([see here for
    some](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/319#issuecomment-789757269)).


    The Sonoff ZBbridge isn't advised since it uses WiFi, and the HUSBZB-1 uses
    an older chipset so should be avoided.
patience:
  content: >-
    People (and other sentient or vaguely intelligent beings) aren't waiting
    here for your questions, ready to leap upon them the moment they appear.
    Have a little patience. Keep in mind that repeatedly posting to get
    attention is against the rules (flooding) and can get you muted or banned.
spam:
  description: "Reporting Spam to Discord"
  content: >-
    You can report spam [Directly to
    Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety)
    and they can act against the account. On this server we can ban the user if
    you provide a screenshot of the spam and the user's handle (eg @spammer#123)
    in <#397426163649216512>.
states:
  description: "States"
  content: >-
    The [_States_
    screen](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states) is your
    truth table for what Home Assistant knows. Every entity is listed here,
    along with the state the system knows (instead of the translated value you
    see elsewhere), and all attributes.
docker:
  description: "Docker based installs"
  content: >-
    If you're using any of the install methods that use Docker (basically
    everything but HA Core) then Home Assistant runs in a container that only
    shares a limited number of folders with the host (or add-ons if you use
    those). If you're working with files outside of `/config/` or certain other
    folders then those only exist _in that container_ and other containers won't
    see them.


    This is commonly experienced when using shell scripts or camera snapshot
    services, when you create a file in `/root` or `/tmp` and then can't find it
    in another container.
blue:
  description: "Home Assistant Blue"
  content: >-
    The [Home Assistant Blue](https://www.home-assistant.io/blue) is an
    ODROID-N2+ in a custom case. The Blue had a limited run and is no longer available,
    but you may still be able to find Odroid N2+ bundles with HA installed available from vendors (without the case).

reply:
  content: >-
    When using Discord's _Reply_ feature it defaults to pinging the person you
    reply to, which can get frustrating for the target. Use _Shift + click_ on
    the _Reply_ option, or click `@ ON` to `@ OFF` to stop this - on the right
    side of the compose bar.


    You have to change this every time (thank the Discord devs for that).

zigbeestick:
  content: >-
    For Zigbee2MQTT any CC2652p (or CC2652) based stick is a good choice. Those
    are also a good choice for ZHA, which also supports the EmberZNet sticks
    ([see here for some
    details](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/319#issuecomment-789757269)).
    Don't pick the cheap CC2530/CC2531 sticks, and avoid the Sonoff Zigbee
    bridge since Zigbee and WiFi aren't friends. If you're not using deCONZ
    avoid the ConBee and RaspBee devices.
yellow:

  content: >-
    See the <#887751499785072711> channel for everything to do with the [Home
    Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow).
trigger:
  description: "Trigger"
  content: >-
    There are three sections to an automation:


    * [**`trigger`**](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/):
    When _any one_ of these _becomes true_ the automation starts processing.
    Only ***one*** trigger is ever responsible for starting an automation, if
    you make a `condition` that checks for more than one having started the
    automation then the condition can never be true.

    *
    [**`condition`**](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/condition/):
    These are checked after a `trigger` starts the processing, and must _be
    true_ for the automation to continue.

    * [**`action`**](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/): This is the
    part that does something, and can also include further conditions.

hasswp:
  description: "hasswp"
  content: >-
    Don't use HassWP, it's unsupported and unsupportable. It runs Home Assistnat
    directly in Windows, which means many things won't work, and relies on the
    developer to keep it updated (which often isn't the case).


    Just use a [supported installation
    approach](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation#compare-installation-methods)
    and you'll have less pain.
pr:
  description: "What about my PR?"
  content: >-
    If you have an open PR and are waiting for feedback, please be patient and
    do not beg for a review. We have a huge backlog of PRs at any given moment
    and while the core reviewers do their best to get to PRs in a timely
    fashion, what's considered timely has grown over time. The best way that you
    can help us get to your PRs faster is to look at other PRs and add your
    reviews - even though PRs need a core reviewer for a formal approval,
    reviews from the community will help reduce the back and forth and make
    reviews easier for the core team.


    With all that being said, if you have an open PR that gets a stale label
    added to it, add a comment so the bot will remove the label, and THEN you
    can post here asking for help since we want to make sure that PRs don't get
    auto-closed because of a lack of feedback.

    [Schedy](https://hass-apps.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apps/schedy/) is a
    highly-configurable, comfortable to use multi-purpose scheduler for Home
    Assistant that controls different types of actors such as switches and
    thermostats based on powerful rules while still facilitating manual
    intervention at any time.


    The goal is to provide an easy solution for conventional scheduling (e.g. by
    time of day and day of week) while leaving advanced users plenty of room for
    customization with arbitrarily complex rules.
sd:

    SD cards die - the more you write to them, the sooner they die. You can get
    a longer life with an Industrial SD card, or ones designed for 24x7 camera
    recording.

    You're better off moving off the SD cards though, either use an SSD or
    replace that Pi with just about any 64 bit capable system from the last
    decade.
supervised:
  description: "Supervised"
  content: >-
    Home Assistant Supervised is considered advanced and should only be used if
    you are an expert in managing a Linux operating system, Docker and
    networking. Maintaining a Debian installation to a very specific set of
    requirements is hard.

    Insecure installations and Unsupported configurations will result if you
    dont know what you are doing.

    You **MAY** regret using this method.

    Sadly we're not mind readers (any more anyway, not after the last time we
    tried). Please [share the YAML and any errors](https://dpaste.org/) so we
    can see what you've done.

    Most mains powered devices are a Zigbee router, for the exceptions [see this

    If you are looking for that specific Blueprint that does that special thing,
    search [The Blueprint
    Exchange](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53)
    because we are not going to search it for you.


    If you are having a problem with a specific Blueprint, the first point of
    contact is in the Exchange (or Github) post that you found the Blueprint in
    originally.


    If that's not working out, this is a good secondary spot for help.
python:

    Python 3.9 is the minimum version of Python supported by Home Assistant,
    with 3.9 being recommended. If you're using a Python virtual environment
    install you can install an updated version of Python, then manually upgrade
    your venv as described in
    <https://blog.ceard.tech/2017/12/upgrading-python-virtual-environment.html>

chatgpt:
  description: "Don't use ChatGPT"
  content: >-
    ChatGPT and other "AI" systems do a fantastic job of generating well structured,
    convincing looking answers... that are either totally garbage or, if you're lucky,
    have subtle flaws. [Don't use them](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/01/23/help-others-leave-ai-at-the-dor/)
    to "help" others, and don't use them yourself.
